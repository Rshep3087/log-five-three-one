# Strength Log
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  A web application using Flask, Chart.js and MySQL for logging strength workouts. Users can add or remove sets for their main lift of the day and also add what accessory excercises they completed that day. If users submit their traning maxes over time, they can track how they have improved with the interactive charts. Users can also track all time personal records in the gym for the core lifts.
  Once a user has built up many pages of training sessions they can filter by the main lift of the training session, which helps users compare previous sessions.
